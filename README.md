The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Data Analysis Project for Coshal focused on transforming raw data into actionable insights. The project began by extracting data from Excel sheets, followed by transforming the data through cleaning processes such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats. This cleaned data was then loaded into SQL for further analysis.

Using SQL queries, key business metrics were analyzed to identify trends in customer behavior, product performance, and sales distribution. Python was used for advanced data manipulation and exploratory analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of patterns within the dataset. Finally, Tableau was used to create visual dashboards, presenting insights on revenue, customer spending, and product performance in an interactive and easy-to-understand format.
